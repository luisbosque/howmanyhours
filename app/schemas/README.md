# Database Schema Export

This directory contains Room database schema export files, which are essential for:

## Purpose
- **Migration Tracking**: Enables safe database schema changes without data loss
- **Version Control**: Each schema version (1.json, 2.json, etc.) represents a database state
- **Migration Development**: Allows creating migration scripts between versions

## Files
- `com.howmanyhours.data.database.AppDatabase/1.json` - Database schema version 1
- Future versions will appear here when schema changes occur

## Important Notes
- ⚠️ **Always commit these files** - They are required for migration safety
- 🔄 **Auto-generated** - Created during build process by Room compiler
- 📈 **Version increments** - New files appear when database version increases

## Migration Safety
With schema export enabled:
- ✅ Room can safely migrate between database versions
- ✅ User data preserved during app updates
- ❌ Without these files: Database would be destroyed on schema changes

## Technical Details
- Generated by: Room's KSP processor during build
- Location configured in: `app/build.gradle.kts` (`room.schemaLocation`)
- Database annotation: `@Database(exportSchema = true)`
